Module 1 - Build your First App from the - [Udacity Developing Android Apps With Kotlin course](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012)

## Some interesting topics learnt

- View Binding
- LinearLayout
- Click Listeners
- Drawable Resources and String Resources
- Use "Empty Activity Views" as a template if not working with the new default 
 Jetpack Compose (The old way is to work with xml layout files to build the UI. 
 The new "Compose" way uses declarative kotlin code instead.)
