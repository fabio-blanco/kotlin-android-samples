## Useful notes from the Codelab study

- TalkBack is not installed by default on Android Emulators. To install it, it's necessary to 
use an emulator with Play Store support and [install it](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback)
- [To use TalKBack follow the instructions to activate it](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6007100)
- To know about how to choose an adequate content description read [Material design Accessibility directives](https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.html#imagery)
or [W3C guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/)
- Thinking about accessibility all images should have an [adequate content description](https://jakearchibald.com/2021/great-alt-text/), 
unless if they are meaningless for the general context of the screen
