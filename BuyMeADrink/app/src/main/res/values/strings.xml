    <string name="about_me_description">
        My name is Fabio and I\'m a software engineer from Brazil. I\'ve been working with software development for about twenty years.
        My main field of actuation is with backend development in Java and Kotlin but I do program in many other languages and I also
        do some front end and mobile development. \n
        I really enjoy working with open source software and, therefore, I use to contribute to some projects.
