This is a collection of Android projects that I maintain mainly for personal use for remembering some technique or code usage guideline. It is basically a collection of samples.

Some of the sample projects in this repository were obtained from third parties and
adjusted to my needs. For those projects the original license was maintained and mentioned in the proper project README.
