        Hi, my name is Fabio
        \n\n I like to play the guitar.
        \n\n I\'m also a woodworker and I like to design furniture.
        \n\n But my profession is software engineer and my role is as staff engineer.
        \n\n At the present time, I\'m working on some personal projects before trying to get hired again.
        \n\n I\'m also studying Kotlin Android development in order to complete my personal projects.
        \n\n I\'m actually reading Staff Engineer from Will Larson.
        \n\n And I have a list of books to read to help me with my growth in my career.
        \n\n Among those are books about coding, refactoring, design to help me improve my technical skills
        \n\n And also books about leadership and management to help me improve in those more specific skills too.
        \n\n I also intend to learn Rust and to improve my Python knowledge.
        \n\n I\'m also experimenting with Clean Architecture and studying Hexagonal Architecture.
